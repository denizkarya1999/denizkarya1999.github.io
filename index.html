            I am Deniz, a student pursuing a Computer Science degree at the University of Michigan-Dearborn`s College of Engineering
            and Computer Science. I have a strong interest on building mobile, desktop and cross-platform applications. I am the
            President and the Studio Lead of the Developers Without Limits, a community where developers voluntarily build
            mobile, desktop and cross-platform application for getting experience before going into industry. As Developers
            Without Limits, we built two projects. Those are Project Husky - a finance application designed with cryptocurrency
            investors in mind and Xase - a database program which helps employers to select the best candidate for software
            engineering positions. During the development process, I collaborated with 14 developers and created 12 UI mockups
            and 8 application pages for Project Husky and the entire form of Xase using Adobe XD, Windows Forms, UWP, XAML,
            MySQL and C#. If you can visit the experience section of my profile, you will be able download Project Husky and Xase.
            I also worked at WolverineSoft Studio as a UI Designer, where I made more than 30 icons and cursors and 6 UI
            mockups. I participate hackathons twice a week to improve my programming, design and team management skills. So
            far I attended 8 hackathons. We build 3 web applications, 4 Universal Windows applications and one Windows Desktop
            Application. One of the most impressive projects I think I made are Children`s Market, Queer Hub, Travelery, Safety
            my hackathon projects. I also have 11 personal projects 7 of them are Windows Desktop Applications, 2 of them are
            Java GUI Applications, 3 of them are Universal Windows Applications, and another one is a GUI design project. One of
            the most impressive projects I think I made are Hirex, 90`s Music, X Calculator and Xurrency. As you visit the featured
            section, you will be able to visit my GitHub profile to see more of my personal projects. I am proficient in C#, Java,
            Python, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS as well as XAML. For the UX/UI design part, I have experience on Adobe
            Creative Cloud Software (primarily Adobe XD and Illustrator), 3DS Max and AutoCAD. For task management, I also
            have experience on Atlassian software products (primarily Trello, Confluence and Jira). Additionally, I speak fluent
            Turkish and conversational German and have success and participation certificates by Automotive Summer Camp
            organized by leading auto manufacturers in Turkey (including Ford Otosan).
